# Text-Statistics-App
Text Statistics App is a junior level demo application written in Java 1.8.
The purpose of the application is to create a statistical summary of text files, such as providing information about the number of words, characters, spaces, lines of text. 
The application gives the number of specific characters used in the text, e.g. the number of vowels, consonants and special signs e.g. !, @, #, $ etc. 
The application also allows to view the number of uppercase and lowercase letters and all characters separately 'a', 'A', 'b', 'B', '1' etc.

To start, go to the AppRunner class.
Additionally, there is also the AppRunner_WordsSearching class responsible for finding chosen words in the text.
As an add-on, the application implements a method that finds characters in the text and replaces characters adjacent to the searched characters. To run this method use AppRunner_CharactersReplacement class.

Technologies used in the project are: IDE - IntelliJ Idea Community; Maven; Java - 1.8; TDD; Design pattern - Facade.
